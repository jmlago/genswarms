  End-to-end tests for reply auto-delivery (genswarms#53 G2), through the REAL
  local backend + szc wrapper: a fake harness binary mimics subzeroclaw's I/O
  contract (NUL-delimited turns in; stderr banners; stdout answer;
  `<<TURN_COMPLETE>>`), and the engine must derive the turn's reply text
  (banners and prompts excluded) and deliver it to the configured `reply_to`
  sink — or emit `no_final_text` when the turn produced none.

  Requires bash + jq (the wrapper's dependencies); skipped when absent.

  async: false — shares the global AgentRegistry/Router.
