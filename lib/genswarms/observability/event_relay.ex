defmodule Genswarms.Observability.EventRelay do
  @moduledoc """
  Bridges the durable SQLite event log to the live PubSub stream.

  In the multi-swarm topology each swarm runs as its own daemon (its own BEAM),
  so its in-memory PubSub broadcasts never reach a central monitor in a different
  process. The one thing every swarm shares is the SQLite `events` table, which
  every swarm writes to via `LogStore` (fed by the telemetry bridge).

  This GenServer runs on the **monitor / API node**. It tails that table and
  re-broadcasts each newly-persisted event onto the exact PubSub topics that
  `LogStore` uses in-node, so the existing `SwarmChannel` delivers them to
  WebSocket clients unchanged. Polling turns the durable log into a live push at
  the edge — no clustering required.

  ## Where to run it

  Start it only where it is the bridge: a monitor/API node that does NOT host
  swarms in-process. On such a node the in-node `LogStore` never broadcasts swarm
  events (they happen in the daemons), so the relay is the sole live source and
  there is no double-delivery. It is started by `Application.start_web_server/1`
  for exactly this reason; daemons don't start the web server.

  Latency is bounded by `:interval` (default 500ms). See `docs/observability.md`.
