defmodule Genswarms.Agents.TurnOutput do
  @moduledoc """
  Derive an agent turn's user-facing reply text from its accumulated output.

  The wrapper (`priv/szc-wrapper-fifo.sh`) emits one JSON object per line of the
  harness's stdout — `{"type":"output","content":"..."}` — and tags harness
  stderr (per-call banners, diagnostics) as `{"type":"log",...}`. The
  AgentServer accumulates these into a single per-turn buffer (lines are
  concatenated as they arrive), so the buffer is a sequence of back-to-back
  JSON objects, possibly with raw text in between (mock/test backends write
  plain text).

  `reply_text/1` reconstructs the harness's stdout for the turn — the
  `"output"`-typed contents in order, plus any raw non-JSON segments — and
  strips the protocol mechanics: `<<TURN_COMPLETE>>` markers and bare `> `
  prompts. Because the harness prints the model's text only when the model
  finishes (and its progress banners go to stderr), what remains IS the turn's
  final answer.

  This is deliberately a pure function so it can be pinned by tests: it is the
  single place that knows the stdout grammar.
  """

  @doc """
  The turn's reply text: harness stdout minus protocol mechanics. `""` when the
  turn produced no user-facing text.

  Total: invalid UTF-8 (a harness `cat`ing a binary file on a wrapper-less
  backend) is handled byte-wise by the scanner, and any unforeseen failure
  degrades to `""` — which the caller surfaces as `no_final_text` — instead of
  crashing the AgentServer mid-turn.
