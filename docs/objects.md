# Objects

Objects are non-agentic components of a swarm. Where an agent is backed by an LLM
that produces free-form text, an object is a plain Elixir module that runs
deterministic code. Objects participate in the swarm topology exactly like
agents: they receive messages, hold state, and send messages to other agents or
objects. They are the right tool for game referees, evaluators, gateways,
schedulers, validators, and bridges between swarms.

Each object is hosted by a `Genswarms.Objects.ObjectServer` (a GenServer). For a
native object the server delegates to a module that implements the
`Genswarms.Objects.ObjectHandler` behaviour. (Objects can also be backed by a
Docker or SSH process that speaks the same JSON protocol over stdin/stdout; this
guide focuses on native handlers, which are the common case.)

## The ObjectHandler behaviour

A native object is any module that declares `@behaviour
Genswarms.Objects.ObjectHandler` and implements its callbacks.

```elixir
defmodule ExampleSwarm.Objects.Evaluator do
  @behaviour Genswarms.Objects.ObjectHandler

  @impl true
  def init(config) do
    {:ok, %{config: config, results: []}}
  end

  @impl true
  def handle_message(from, content, state) do
    {:reply, "ack", state}
  end

  @impl true
  def interface do
    %{evaluate: %{input: "JSON list of configs", output: "JSON with results"}}
  end
end
```

### Callbacks

| Callback | Required | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `init(config)` | yes | Build the handler's initial state from its declared config map. |
| `handle_message(from, content, state)` | yes | React to a message routed from another node. |
| `interface()` | yes | Return a schema describing the object's actions (introspection). |
| `handle_info(msg, state)` | no | Handle process messages such as timers. |
| `terminate(reason, state)` | no | Cleanup when the object stops. |

`handle_info/2` and `terminate/2` are optional callbacks; the `ObjectServer`
checks at runtime whether the handler exports them before calling them.

## init/1

`init/1` is called once when the `ObjectServer` starts. `config` is the map you
provide in the swarm configuration under the object's `:config` key.

```elixir
@callback init(config :: map()) ::
            {:ok, state}
            | {:ok, state, {:send, to, content}}
            | {:error, reason}
```

| Return value | Semantics |
|--------------|-----------|
| `{:ok, state}` | Initialize with `state`; do nothing else. |
| `{:ok, state, {:send, to, content}}` | Initialize, then send an opening message to `to`. |
| `{:ok, state, {:multi, messages}}` | Initialize, then send several opening messages (see below). |
| `{:error, reason}` | Initialization failed; the object enters an error state. |

The `{:ok, state, {:send, to, content}}` form is how an object kicks off a
conversation. The tic-tac-toe game uses it to send the first turn to the opening
player:

```elixir
@impl true
def init(_config) do
  board = [[".", ".", "."], [".", ".", "."], [".", ".", "."]]
  state = %{board: board, turn: :player_x, game_over: false, winner: nil, move_count: 0}
  {:ok, state, {:send, :player_x, encode(:your_turn, %{board: board})}}
end
```

The `{:ok, state, {:multi, messages}}` form accepts a list of
`{:send, to, content}` and `{:broadcast, content}` tuples and dispatches all of
them after initialization.

## handle_message/3

`handle_message/3` runs for every message routed to the object. `from` is the
sender's name (an atom), `content` is the message string, and `state` is the
current handler state. The return tuple tells the `ObjectServer` what to send
and how to update state.

```elixir
@callback handle_message(from :: atom(), content :: String.t(), state) ::
            {:reply, response, new_state}
            | {:send, to, content, new_state}
            | {:broadcast, content, new_state}
            | {:noreply, new_state}
```

The handler may also return the multi-message tuples below. The full set of
return tuples honored by the `ObjectServer` is:

| Return tuple | Semantics |
|--------------|-----------|
| `{:reply, response, new_state}` | Route `response` back to the original sender (`from`). |
| `{:send, to, content, new_state}` | Route `content` to a specific node `to`. |
| `{:broadcast, content, new_state}` | Send `content` to every node connected to this object in the topology. |
| `{:noreply, new_state}` | Update state only; send nothing. |
| `{:send_many, messages, new_state}` | Send several messages at once (flexible item shapes — see below). |
| `{:multi, messages, new_state}` | Send several messages at once (tagged item shapes only). |

All routed targets are subject to the topology: a message only reaches `to` if
there is an edge from this object to `to` (or `to` is a system object — see
below).

### `:send_many` vs `:multi`

Both forms emit multiple messages from a single callback return. They differ
only in the item shapes they accept.

`:multi` accepts tagged tuples only:

```elixir
{:multi,
 [
   {:send, :player_x, "your move"},
   {:broadcast, "game starting"}
 ], new_state}
```

`:send_many` accepts tagged tuples *and* bare `{target, msg}` pairs, so you can
mix styles:

```elixir
{:send_many,
 [
   {:player_x, "your move"},          # bare {target, msg}
   {:send, :player_o, "stand by"},    # tagged send
   {:broadcast, "game starting"}      # tagged broadcast
 ], new_state}
```

Use `:send_many` when it is convenient to build a keyword-like list of
`{target, msg}` pairs; use `:multi` when you want every item explicitly tagged.

### Worked example: a turn-validating game object

The tic-tac-toe `Game` object shows the common return tuples in one handler. It
replies to the sender on an invalid move, sends the next turn to the other
player on a valid move, and broadcasts the final result when the game ends.

```elixir
@impl true
def handle_message(from, content, state) do
  cond do
    state.game_over ->
      {:reply, encode(:error, "Game over."), state}

    from != state.turn ->
      {:reply, encode(:error, "Not your turn, waiting for #{state.turn}"), state}

    true ->
      process_move(from, content, state)
  end
end

defp process_move(from, content, state) do
  # ... validate, update board ...
  case check_result(new_board) do
    {:win, p} ->
      winner = if p == "X", do: :player_x, else: :player_o
      {:broadcast, encode(:game_over, %{board: new_board, winner: winner}), final}

    :draw ->
      {:broadcast, encode(:game_over, %{board: new_board, winner: "draw"}), final}

    :continue ->
      {:send, next, encode(:your_turn, %{board: new_board}), new_state}
  end
end
```

## handle_info/2 for timers and process messages

Objects are GenServers, so they can receive ordinary process messages. Implement
the optional `handle_info/2` callback to react to timers scheduled with
`Process.send_after/3` or other Erlang messages. It returns the same tuples as
`handle_message/3` (including `:send_many` and `:multi`):

```elixir
@impl true
def init(_config) do
  Process.send_after(self(), :tick, 1_000)
  {:ok, %{ticks: 0}}
end

@impl true
def handle_info(:tick, state) do
  Process.send_after(self(), :tick, 1_000)
  {:broadcast, "tick #{state.ticks}", %{state | ticks: state.ticks + 1}}
end
```

A `:reply` returned from `handle_info/2` has no original sender to reply to, so
the `ObjectServer` treats it as a state-only update.

## interface/0 introspection

`interface/0` returns a map describing the actions the object supports and their
expected input/output. It is used for display in `swarm-msg` and dashboards and
does not affect routing. By convention each key is an action name pointing at a
map with `:input` and `:output` descriptions.

```elixir
@impl true
def interface do
  %{
    move: %{
      input: ~s({"board": [["X",".","."],[".",".","."],[".",".","."]]}),
      output: "Validates move, sends board to next player or announces winner"
    }
  }
end
```

## Logging from an object

Handlers can write structured entries to the centralized event log via
`Genswarms.Objects.ObjectServer.log/5`:

```elixir
alias Genswarms.Objects.ObjectServer

ObjectServer.log(:info, "example-swarm", :game, "Move accepted", %{player: from})
```

The arguments are `level`, `swarm_name`, `object_name`, `message`, and an
optional `metadata` map. See [observability.md](observability.md) for how these
events are queried and streamed.

## Declaring objects in a swarm

Objects are listed under the `:objects` key of a swarm configuration. Each entry
needs a `:name` and a `:handler`; the optional `:config` map is passed verbatim
to the handler's `init/1`. Objects appear in `:topology` edges just like agents.

```elixir
Code.require_file("objects/game.ex", __DIR__)

%{
  name: "example-swarm",
  agents: [
    %{name: :player_x, backend: {:docker, "szc-agent-code:latest"}, skills: ["player_x.md"]},
    %{name: :player_o, backend: {:docker, "szc-agent-code:latest"}, skills: ["player_o.md"]}
  ],
  objects: [
    %{
      name: :game,
      handler: ExampleSwarm.Objects.Game,
      config: %{}
    }
  ],
  topology: [
    {:player_x, :game},
    {:game, :player_x},
    {:player_o, :game},
    {:game, :player_o}
  ]
}
```

The `config` map is how you parameterize an object. The bridge object, for
instance, receives its swarm name and a routing table:

```elixir
objects: [
  %{
    name: :bridge,
    handler: ExampleSwarm.Objects.Bridge,
    config: %{
      swarm_name: "example-swarm",
      routing: %{messenger_a: {"swarm-b", :messenger_b}}
    }
  }
]
```

See [configuration.md](configuration.md) for the full configuration DSL.

## System objects

The router always allows messages to three reserved system object names, even
when no explicit topology edge exists:

| Name | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `:metrics` | Metrics sink. |
| `:tick` | Clock / scheduling. |
| `:gateway` | External gateway. |

These are defined as `@system_objects` in
`lib/genswarms/routing/router.ex`. Any node may send to them without declaring an
edge; define a handler for them only if you want to act on what they receive.
