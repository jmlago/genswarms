# Observability

GenSwarms exposes everything that happens in a swarm through a single event spine.
Every observable state transition emits a `:telemetry` event, a bridge funnels
those into a centralized store, and the store persists, streams, and serves them.
Understanding that spine is the key to building any dashboard, monitor, or alerting
on top of the framework.

## The single spine

There is one rule: every observable state transition emits a `:telemetry` event,
and nothing else logs it. A telemetry bridge funnels those events into `LogStore`,
which both persists them (ETS + durable store) and streams them over PubSub /
WebSocket.

A transition is logged in exactly one place: its `emit_telemetry/2,3` call. The
emitter never also calls `LogStore.log` for the same moment. `LogStore.log` is
reserved for diagnostics and I/O that have no transition event: backend container
ops, raw agent stdout, received messages, config-load failures. Those are
single-source, so they never double up with the bridge.

```
emit_telemetry(:agent_started, ...)              # emitters (swarm_manager, agent_server, ...)
        |  [:genswarms, :agent, :agent_started]
        v
Genswarms.Observability.TelemetryBridge            # single :telemetry handler
        |  LogStore.log(:info, :agent, :agent_started, "agent fixer_1 started", ...)
        v
Genswarms.Observability.LogStore
        |-- ETS ring buffer        -> LogStore.query / GET /api/events (fast, in-node)
        |-- EventStore (durable)   -> cross-process / `genswarms events` CLI
        +-- PubSub {:log_event, e} -> SwarmChannel "event" / "log_entry" push (live)
```

To make a new transition observable, emit a telemetry event under
`[:genswarms, <domain>, <event>]` and add it to
`Genswarms.Observability.TelemetryBridge` `known_events/0`. Nothing else: no
controller, no broadcast, no `LogStore` call at the call site.

The bridge attaches **once at application start**
(`Genswarms.Observability.TelemetryBridge.attach/0`, called by
`Genswarms.Application.start/2` after the supervision tree is up). It attaches to
the concrete `[:genswarms, domain, event]` triples in `known_events/0` — not a
prefix — so unrelated `:genswarms` telemetry is never swept in. The handler is
wrapped in a rescue: if a translation fails it logs a warning and drops the event
rather than taking down the emitting process.

The bridge derives the log `level` from the event name. When the level depends on
the outcome (a partial swarm start, an unexpected agent exit), the emitter passes
`level:` in the telemetry metadata to set it explicitly; the bridge strips that key
before persisting, so it never leaks into the payload.

## Event taxonomy

`level` is derived from the event name. The exact rules
(`TelemetryBridge.level_for/1`), checked in order against the event-name string:

| Substring in event name | Level |
|---|---|
| contains `error` | `:error` |
| contains `failed` | `:error` |
| contains `invalid` | `:warning` |
| contains `not_found` | `:warning` |
| contains `full` | `:warning` |
| otherwise | `:info` |

A `level:` key in the telemetry metadata overrides this derivation for that event.

`category` is the telemetry domain, with one normalization: the `:router` domain
is mapped to the `:routing` category. All other domains pass through unchanged
(`:swarm`, `:agent`, `:object`).

The full vocabulary the bridge knows
(`Genswarms.Observability.TelemetryBridge.known_events/0`):

| Domain (category) | Event | Level | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `swarm` | `swarm_started` | info | swarm finished starting (emitters may pass `level:` for a partial start) |
| `swarm` | `swarm_stopped` | info | swarm torn down |
| `agent` | `agent_started` | info | agent process up |
| `agent` | `agent_stopped` | info | agent process exited |
| `agent` | `agent_error` | error | agent backend/runtime error |
| `agent` | `agent_added` | info | agent added to a running swarm |
| `agent` | `agent_removed` | info | agent removed from a running swarm |
| `agent` | `task_sent` | info | task delivered to an agent |
| `agent` | `message_delivered` | info | message delivered to target inbox |
| `object` | `object_started` | info | object handler initialized |
| `object` | `object_stopped` | info | object handler stopped |
| `object` | `object_error` | error | object handler crashed/errored |
| `object` | `object_added` | info | object added to a running swarm |
| `object` | `object_removed` | info | object removed from a running swarm |
| `routing` | `message_routed` | info | direct message routed (`:from`, `:to`) |
| `routing` | `message_broadcast` | info | broadcast routed (`:from`) |
| `routing` | `invalid_route` | warning | message rejected by topology |

Every event carries `:swarm` in its metadata. Agent events also carry `:agent`,
and object events carry `:object`. The bridge lifts the swarm name into the event's
`:swarm` field and lifts **either** the agent name **or** the object name into the
event's `:agent` field (`agent: metadata[:agent] || metadata[:object]`) — there is
no separate object column, so object events appear under the same `agent` field /
`-a` / `?agent=` filter as agents. The bridge then drops `:swarm`, `:agent`, and
`:object` from the remaining metadata (and the `:level` override key) and keeps the
rest as a JSON-friendly `metadata` blob.

## Telemetry events and metrics

Raw telemetry events are emitted under `[:genswarms, <domain>, <event>]` with
metadata that always includes `:swarm` (and `:agent` for agent events). The
`Genswarms.Telemetry` supervisor declares a set of `Telemetry.Metrics` definitions
(consumable by LiveDashboard or any reporter). Metric names follow
`genswarms.<domain>.<event>`:

| Metric | Type | Tags | Source event |
|---|---|---|---|
| `genswarms.swarm.swarm_started.count` | counter | `:swarm` | `[:genswarms, :swarm, :swarm_started]` |
| `genswarms.swarm.swarm_stopped.count` | counter | `:swarm` | `[:genswarms, :swarm, :swarm_stopped]` |
| `genswarms.swarm.agent_count` | last_value | `:swarm` | `[:genswarms, :swarm, :agent_count]` |
| `genswarms.agent.agent_started.count` | counter | `:swarm`, `:agent` | `[:genswarms, :agent, :agent_started]` |
| `genswarms.agent.agent_stopped.count` | counter | `:swarm`, `:agent` | `[:genswarms, :agent, :agent_stopped]` |
| `genswarms.agent.agent_error.count` | counter | `:swarm`, `:agent` | `[:genswarms, :agent, :agent_error]` |
| `genswarms.agent.task_sent.count` | counter | `:swarm`, `:agent` | `[:genswarms, :agent, :task_sent]` |
| `genswarms.agent.message_delivered.count` | counter | `:swarm`, `:agent` | `[:genswarms, :agent, :message_delivered]` |
| `genswarms.router.message_routed.count` | counter | `:swarm` | `[:genswarms, :router, :message_routed]` |
| `genswarms.router.message_broadcast.count` | counter | `:swarm` | `[:genswarms, :router, :message_broadcast]` |
| `genswarms.router.invalid_route.count` | counter | `:swarm` | `[:genswarms, :router, :invalid_route]` |

The `genswarms.swarm.agent_count` last-value is produced by a periodic
`:telemetry_poller` measurement (period 10s) that calls
`Genswarms.Telemetry.measure_swarms/0`, which polls `Genswarms.SwarmManager.list/0`
and emits `[:genswarms, :swarm, :agent_count]` per swarm. (`agent_count` is a
metrics-only event — it is **not** in `known_events/0`, so the bridge does not turn
it into a `LogStore` event; it never appears in the queryable event stream.)
Standard Phoenix and BEAM VM metrics (`phoenix.endpoint.*`,
`phoenix.router_dispatch.*`, `phoenix.live_view.mount.*`, `vm.memory.total`,
`vm.total_run_queue_lengths.*`) are also registered.

## The EventStore behaviour

The durable, cross-process log sits behind one swappable interface,
`Genswarms.Observability.EventStore` (a behaviour plus a facade). Everything that
persists, reads, or tails events goes through it (`LogStore`, `EventRelay`, the
controllers, the channel, and the CLI), never a concrete backend. The backend is a
single config knob.

The callbacks are: `persist/1`, `query/1`, `events_since/2`, `max_event_id/0`, an
optional `persist_many/1` (bulk write), and an optional `child_specs/0` (processes
the backend needs supervised; the app splices them into its tree at boot via
`EventStore.child_specs/0`).

```elixir
@callback persist(event()) :: :ok
@callback persist_many([event()]) :: :ok                              # optional
@callback query(keyword()) :: [event()]
@callback events_since(since_id :: non_neg_integer(), limit :: pos_integer()) :: [event()]
@callback max_event_id() :: non_neg_integer()
@callback child_specs() :: [Supervisor.child_spec()]                  # optional

@optional_callbacks child_specs: 0, persist_many: 1
```

The facade provides safe defaults for the optional callbacks: if a backend does not
export `persist_many/1`, `EventStore.persist_many/1` falls back to N× `persist/1`;
if it does not export `child_specs/0`, `EventStore.child_specs/0` returns `[]`. The
event shape passed to `persist/1` is a map with `:level`, `:category`,
`:event_type`, `:message` and optional `:swarm`, `:agent`, `:metadata`; reads
return the same maps additionally carrying `:id` and `:timestamp` (assigned by the
backend).

### Backends

| Backend | Role |
|---|---|
| `EventStore.Sqlite` | Thin adapter over the `events` table in `.genswarms/swarms.db` (managed by `SwarmRegistry`). Stateless and synchronous — each call opens a short-lived connection — so it declares no `child_specs/0` (no supervised process). |
| `EventStore.Buffered` | Engine-independent write-batching decorator wrapping any inner backend. The default. |

The default in `config/config.exs` batches writes on top of SQLite:

```elixir
config :genswarms, :event_store, Genswarms.Observability.EventStore.Buffered

config :genswarms, Genswarms.Observability.EventStore.Buffered,
  inner: Genswarms.Observability.EventStore.Sqlite,
  interval_ms: 100,
  max_buffer: 1_000
```

`EventStore.Buffered` enqueues each `persist/1` (and `persist_many/1`) into a
`Writer` GenServer and flushes the batch via the inner backend's `persist_many/1`
on a 100ms timer (or sooner when `max_buffer` is reached). It also declares the
`Writer` (plus any of the inner backend's own children) through its `child_specs/0`,
so the app supervises it. This keeps disk writes off `LogStore`'s critical path and
lets the inner backend amortize them: with `EventStore.Sqlite`, one
`open -> BEGIN -> inserts -> COMMIT -> close` per flush instead of a connection per
event. The tradeoff is a small durability window (at most one flush interval) on a
hard crash; the live in-node path (ETS + PubSub) is synchronous and unaffected. The
buffer is flushed on graceful shutdown via the `Writer`'s `terminate/2`.

Tests run with the plain synchronous `EventStore.Sqlite` backend so that
`persist -> query` is deterministic with no buffering (`config/test.exs` sets
`config :genswarms, :event_store, Genswarms.Observability.EventStore.Sqlite`).

To raise throughput under load, tune the buffer (fewer, larger commits in exchange
for a slightly larger latency/durability window):

```elixir
config :genswarms, Genswarms.Observability.EventStore.Buffered,
  inner: Genswarms.Observability.EventStore.Sqlite,
  interval_ms: 250,
  max_buffer: 5_000
```

Because every caller goes through the facade, a future `EventStore.Postgres` or a
Redis/streaming backend can be swapped in transparently: only the backend module
changes, not the emitters, the bridge, the channel, or `EventRelay`.

## Cross-process event stream

A BEAM's in-memory machinery (PubSub, the process `Registry`, the ETS `LogStore`)
is node-local and invisible from another OS process. GenSwarms supports two
deployment shapes.

Co-located: the swarm runs in the same BEAM as the Phoenix endpoint (for example,
started in-process via `POST /api/swarms`). Live PubSub, the WebSocket stream, and
the live snapshot endpoints all work directly. Nothing special is needed.

Monitor + daemons: the usual shape at scale. Each swarm runs as its own daemon
(`genswarms start`, its own BEAM), and a separate monitor/API node observes all of
them. The only thing the processes share is the SQLite `events` table in
`.genswarms/swarms.db`.

```
daemon swarm A --+  emit_telemetry -> LogStore -> SQLite events  --+
daemon swarm B --+                                                 +--> shared .genswarms/swarms.db
daemon swarm C --+                                                 --+
                                                                   |
                  monitor / API node ---- EventRelay polls events_since --+
                                                                   |       |
                  REST /api/events  -- reads SQLite ---------------+       v
                  WS swarm:<name>   <- EventRelay re-broadcasts {:log_event} onto
                                       the same LogStore PubSub topics -> SwarmChannel push
```

- `GET /api/events` (and the swarm/agent variants) read SQLite, so they surface
  every swarm, daemon or in-process.
- `Genswarms.Observability.EventRelay` runs on the monitor node. It tails new
  SQLite rows every 500ms (the `:interval` default; batches of 500 via
  `EventStore.events_since/2`) and re-broadcasts them onto the in-node PubSub
  topics (`log_store:events` and `log_store:events:<swarm>`), mirroring
  `LogStore.broadcast_event/1` exactly, so the existing `SwarmChannel` pushes them
  to WebSocket clients live, with no clustering required. It starts from the
  current tip on boot (relays only new events going forward; history comes from the
  subscribe-time snapshot). Latency is approximately the poll interval.
- A WebSocket client gets recent history from the snapshot on subscribe (also read
  from SQLite) and the live tail from the relay.

The relay is started by `Genswarms.Application.start_web_server/1`
(`maybe_start_event_relay/0`) — and only there, so daemons (which never start the
web server) do not run it. Run it only on a monitor/API node that does not host
swarms in-process: there the in-node `LogStore` never broadcasts swarm events (they
happen in the daemons), so the relay is the sole live source and there is no
double-delivery. To disable it explicitly, set:

```elixir
config :genswarms, :event_relay, false
```

### Still node-local (known limits)

- Live process-state pulls (`GET /objects/:name`, `/agents/:name`) call into the
  in-node `Registry`, so they only reach swarms in the same BEAM. For daemon
  swarms, rely on the event stream (and `GET /swarms/:name`, which has a SQLite
  fallback) instead of synchronous state pulls.
- Object internal state changes do not emit events (only object lifecycle does), so
  a live object-state feed is not available: poll `GET /objects/:name` in a
  co-located setup, or have the object emit on change.
- For true sub-second push or cross-host fan-out without polling, swap
  `Phoenix.PubSub` to its Redis adapter; the single spine means only the transport
  changes, not the emitters, bridge, or channel.

## Querying events

### CLI

`genswarms events` reads the durable spine, so it surfaces daemon swarms running in
other BEAMs by reading the `events` table in `.genswarms/swarms.db`.

```bash
genswarms events                      # recent events across all swarms
genswarms events -s my-swarm          # one swarm
genswarms events --category routing   # filter by category (backend|routing|agent|object|swarm|system)
genswarms events --errors             # errors only
genswarms events --follow             # stream in real time
```

The `--category` values map 1:1 to the taxonomy above (and include `object`). See
[cli.md](cli.md) for the full command reference.

### REST API

History endpoints are backed by the same spine and read from SQLite, so they cover
every swarm:

| Endpoint | Returns |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/events` | recent events, filterable by `level`/`category`/`swarm`/`agent`/`event_type`/`minutes`/`limit` |
| `GET /api/swarms/:name/events` | events for one swarm |
| `GET /api/swarms/:name/agents/:agent_name/events` | events for one agent |

Snapshot endpoints (current state) complement the history:

| Endpoint | Returns |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/swarms/:name` | swarm status, agents, objects, counts |
| `GET /api/swarms/:name/topology` | topology adjacency |
| `GET /api/swarms/:name/objects` | objects + lifecycle state |
| `GET /api/swarms/:name/objects/:object_name` | one object's live domain state |
| `GET /api/swarms/:name/agents/:agent_name` | one agent's status |

See [rest-api.md](rest-api.md) for full details.

### Real-time (WebSocket / PubSub)

On the `swarm:<name>` channel, subscribe and patch a view from the push stream.
The channel subscribes to the per-swarm PubSub topics on join (`swarm:<name>`,
plus `:output`, `:routing`, and `:status` sub-topics) and pushes these
server→client messages (all confirmed in `SwarmChannel.handle_info/2`):

| Push | Source |
|---|---|
| `event`, `log_entry` | `LogStore` (the whole taxonomy, after `subscribe_events` / `subscribe_logs`) |
| `agent_output` | agent stdout |
| `agent_status` | agent state transition |
| `message_routed`, `message_broadcast` | router |
| `swarm_started`, `swarm_stopped` | swarm lifecycle |
| `agent_added`, `agent_removed`, `topology_changed` | dynamic mutations |

Within a single BEAM, code can subscribe directly with
`Genswarms.Observability.LogStore.subscribe/0` (all events as `{:log_event, event}`)
or `LogStore.subscribe/1` (one swarm). See [websocket.md](websocket.md) for the
channel protocol.

## Building a dashboard

A dashboard is a consumer, not framework code (the project is API-first and
headless by design; no HTML ships here):

1. Bootstrap from the snapshot endpoints (status + topology + objects).
2. Open the `swarm:<name>` channel, `subscribe_events` for the taxonomy, and patch
   the view from the push stream.
3. Domain-specific concepts (for example user "sessions" or conversation
   transcripts) live in the consumer and read from the consumer's own store; the
   framework stays generic and exposes only generic object state via the
   introspection endpoint above.
